# Documentation for compiling the project

*******

Type `make` to execute the Makefile. 

The make command is used to automate the build process by ensuring recompile the executable binary when one of the files changed sources on which it depends.

*******

Type `make clean` to cleanup files.

It cleans up by deleting all files that can be returned to rebuild from sources: *.o binaries etc.
